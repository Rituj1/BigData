1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location

3. create table sales_order_csv

CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1")
; 

4. load data local inpath 'file:///tmp/hive_class_3/sales_order_data.csv into table sales_order_csv;

5. create table sales_order_orc
